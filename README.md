# mod6-weatherApp

This weather app will allow a user to search for a city of their choice and see the current temp displayed on one card and the 5 day forecast displayed on another 5 cards. Their search history will also be saved.
I learned so much about APIs and searching through data from this project, which was really interesting!
Thank you!
